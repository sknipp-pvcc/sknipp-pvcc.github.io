					<tr>
						<th>Term</th>
						<th>Definition</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Machine Language</th>
						<th>A branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Debugging</th>
						<th>A multistep process that involves identifying a problem, isolating the source of the problem, and then either correcting the problem or determining a way to work around it.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Assembler</th>
						<th>A program that takes basic computer instructions and converts them into a pattern of bits that the computer's processor can use to perform its basic operations.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Assembly Language</th>
						<th>A type of low-level programming language that is intended to communicate directly with a computer's hardware.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Translator</th>
						<th>A program that converts source code into object code.</th>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Compiler</th>
						<th>A special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Interpreter</th>
						<th>A computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.</th>
						 
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Cross-Platform Software</th>
						<th>A product or system that can work across multiple types of platforms or operating environments.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Natural Language</th>
						<th>Processing helps computers communicate with humans in their own language and scales other language-related tasks. For example, NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Formal Language</th>
						<th>A language designed for use in situations in which natural language is unsuitable, as for example in mathematics, logic, or computer programming. The symbols and formulas of such languages stand in precisely specified syntactic and semantic relations to one another.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Machine Independence</th>
						<th>A term applied to software that is not dependent on the properties of a particular machine, and can therefore be used on any machine.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>High-Level Programming Language</th>
						<th>A any programming language that enables development of a program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</th>
						<th>A style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Scripting Language</th>
						<th>A programming language that employs a high-level construct to interpret and execute one command at a time.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Data Types:</th>
						<th>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Integer: represents whole numbers (no fractional parts)</li>
                                <li>Float: A data type composed of a number that is not an integer, because it includes a fraction represented in decimal format.</li>
                                <li>String: An array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding.</li>


                            </ul>
                        </th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Primitive Data Type</th>
						<th>A set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Data Structure</th>
						<th>A specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Python Collection Data Structures</th>
						<th>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Tuple: Used to store multiple items in a single variable, they are ordered and unchangeable, and written with round brackets.</li>
                                <li>Set: A collection which is unordered, unchangable, and unindexed.</li>
                                <li>Dictionary: sed to store data values in key:value pairsand  a collection which is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Function</th>
						<th>A unit of code that is often defined by its role within a greater code structure.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Local Variable</th>
						<th>A variable that is given local scope.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Global Variable</th>
						<th>A variable with global scope, meaning that it is visible (hence accessible) throughout the program, unless shadowed.</th>
						
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<th>Source Program</th>
						<th>A text file that contains instructions written in a high level language</th>
						
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>Object Program</th>
						<th>A computer program translated from the equivalent source program into machine language by the compiler or assembler.</th>
						
					</tr>
