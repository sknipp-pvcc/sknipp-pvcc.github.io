                                <li>One-to-Many: A type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two entities (see also entity–relationship model) A and B in which an element of A may be linked to many elements of B, but a member of B is linked to only one element of A. For instance, think of A as books, and B as pages. A book can have many pages, but a page can only be in one book</li>

								For example, think of A as Authors, and B as Books. An Author can write several Books, and a Book can be written by several Authors.</li>
