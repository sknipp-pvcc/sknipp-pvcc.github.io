		<ul><strong><em>Q:</strong>What is a version control system?</ul></em>
		
		<ul><strong>A:</strong>Also known as source code, is the practice of tracking and managing chages to software code. </ul>
		
		<ul><strong><em>Q:</strong>What is Git?</ul></em>
		
		<ul><strong>A:</strong>(a software) At its core, Git is a free, open-source software distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to manage all source code history. It can keep a history of commits, can reverse changes, and lets developers share code </ul> 
		
		<ul><strong><em>Q:</strong>What is GitHub?</ul></em>
		
		<ul><strong>A:</strong>(a service) A web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It offers all of Git’s DVCS SCM and has some additional features. This includes collaboration functionality like project management, support ticket management, and bug tracking. With GitHub, developers can share their repositories, access other developers’ repositories, and store remote copies of repositories to serve as backups.</ul>
   
		<ul><strong><em>Q:</strong>What is the difference between Git and GitHub?</ul></em>
		
		<ul><strong>A:</strong>The main Git vs GitHub difference is in their functionality. While they both provide source code management (SCM) and make merging and sharing code easier, this is pretty much where their similarities end. Think of Git as a single computer and GitHub as a network of multiple interconnected computers, all with the same end goal but a wildly different role for how to get there.</ul>
		
		<ul><strong><em>Q:</strong>Who started Github and how was it started?</ul></em>
		
		<ul><strong>A:</strong>GitHub was launched as a company in 2008 and acquired by Microsoft in 2018.</ul>
		
		<ul><strong><em>Q:</strong>What company owns it now?</ul></em>
		
		<ul><strong>A:</strong>Microsoft</ul>
		
		<ul><strong><em>Q:</strong>How much does a GitHub account cost?</ul></em>
		
		<ul><strong>A:</strong>Different Tiers: Free for Individuals, $44 per user per year for teams, and $231 per user per year for Enterprise accounts</ul>
		
		<ul><strong><em>Q:</strong>What is the Octocat?</ul></em>
		
		<ul><strong>A:</strong>the mascot of the source-code hosting service GitHub. Octocat, part cat, part octopus character in Spliced (TV series) Octocat Adventure, a five-part animated video by David OReilly (artist)</ul>
